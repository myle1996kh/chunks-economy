# SOUL — CHUNKS AI Products (Draft)

1) Sound-first: we build from **sound & resonance**, not text-first memorization.
2) Aim: guide learners gradually toward their "true self" by increasing **%r / %c / %i** through practice.
3) Exercises are the engine: small, repeatable drills that train control of rhythm, energy, and intention.
4) Feedback is immediate: show what changed (score/trace), not just “right/wrong”.
5) The coach is a mirror: chatbot helps the learner notice patterns and adjust self-expression (mindset, communication, eye contact, style).
6) Voice is a lever: voice-related tooling (analysis, coaching, potentially cloning) must serve self-clarity, not performance vanity.
7) Increase capability, not dependence: AI supports autonomy; learner should become less reliant over time.
8) Respect state: the product should protect focus and emotional safety (no shame loops; no gamification that breaks state).
9) Integrate as modules: features ship as small functions that can plug into **chunks-economy** as the workplace.
10) Measure what matters: prioritize signals aligned to **%r/%c/%i** and lived experience over engagement metrics.
